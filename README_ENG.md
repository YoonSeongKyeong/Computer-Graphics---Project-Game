## **GAME DESCRIPTION**

### **< Title >**
#### It turned the battle in the space into a game.
#### The motif is "Super Hot," a time-stop game and a scene in slow motion in the movie "Matrix" starring Keanu Reeves.
#### The game is a shooting game, and based on the theme of the main character's fight against the enemy's attack, the concept is that if the protagonist stops, time slows down.  

### **< Game Play >**
#### Run the time_attack.exe file in the bin folder.

### **< Control Description >**
#### By default, the main character moves through the WASD key, and a right-click will fire the bullet into that location. Each bullet gets tired and weak in each fire, but every time it hits the enemy, it levels up and becomes stronger.
#### If you left-click, the main character moves to that location while stopping for a while. Stopping time can be used as an opportunity to reverse it. The skill cool time is displayed in the upper left corner.
#### The main character flashes and becomes invincible when hit by an enemy or when using a skill.

### **< Game Rule Description >**
#### The protagonist has four lives and each time he is hit by an enemy, one life disappears. When Life reaches zero, the game ends.
#### The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score. The score increases with the duration of the fight, and each time you kill an enemy, you get an extra score.
#### The score you receive is much higher in Normal mode than in Easy mode, and much higher in Hard mode than in Normal mode. Game mode is the normal mode by default. Press y to play in Easy mode, h to play in Hard mode.
#### The score you get is also much higher than when the main character stops moving at the time of death. You can get more points if you play more Challenging.
